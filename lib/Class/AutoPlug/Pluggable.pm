=head1 NAME

Class::AutoPlug::Pluggable  - automatically make a non-pluggable class pluggable

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  package Nonpluggable::Class::Pluggable;
  use base qw(Class::AutoPlug::Pluggable);
  1;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

C<Class::AutoPlug::Pluggable> provides a means to automatically add pluggability to any class
without it. The plugin modules can not only export methods into the new base pluggable class, but
can also define prehooks and posthooks for any method supported by the base class.

Prehooks get control before the method is called, and posthooks are called after the method.
You can bypass the call altogether or alter what the call does via these hooks. See
C<Class::AutoPlug::Plugin> for details on writing hooks.

This class simply sets up the necessary infrastructure; you need write no code whatsoever in
classes which use it.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 new(...)

The B<new> method takes exactly the parameters that the base class supports and passes them along
to its constructor. The resulting object is cached internall and is used to execute actual calls to
the base class's methods.

You may add extra parameters to be handled by your plugins; see C<Class::AutoPlug::Plugin> for
details on how to do this. The extra parameters can either be left in the parameter list or 
deleted by the plugins.

=head2 pre_hook($method_name, $hook_sub_ref)

The B<prehook> method adds a prehook to the named method. The order in which the hooks are added
is currently not directly controllable by the plugin writer (it's actually done in collation order
of the names of the plugins).

=head2 post_hook($method_name, $hook_sub_ref)

The B<posthook> method adds a posthook in much the same way as prehook() adds a prehook.

=head2 insert_hook($queue_name, $method_name, $hook_sub_ref)

Allows you to explicitly address a hook queue and add a hook to it; you probably don't want to 
use this unless you're creating a completely new queue for your own purposes. This method will
generally be called in a plugin because you need the address of a hook subroutine to use it.
(It's certainly possible to, for instance, only set up a hook in the module which uses 
C<Class::AutoPlug::Pluggable> and not use a plugin at all. This might be useful if you just want
to use this module to "front-end" a few method calls in another module.)

=head2 remove_hook($queue_name, $method_name, $hook_sub_ref)

Allows you to remove a hook from a hook queue. Very similar to insert_hook(). Note that as long as
you have a reference to a subroutine which is being used as a hook, you can remove it using this
method, ev en if the code doing the remove_hook() wasn't the one that set the hook in the first 
place!

=head2 base_obj

Returns a reference to the internally-cached base-class object. Makes it easy for plugins
to call methods directly without running any of the hooks.

=head2 last_method

The name of the last method called on this object. Can be useful if you want to be able to send
another message to the object from within a hook without losing track of what method was called.
